# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?


My time management could always be better. I am staying on task (not getting my attention diverted). And working dilligently. The trouble comes with getting tripped up on something small that takes me a while to remember/ figure out. I write down an idea to look into something more, if I figured it out enough to move on, but don't quite understand the problems. I'd love support of any kind. After a lifetime of undiagnosed ADHD, I've been learning time management techniques over the last year, but always am eager to learn more. I appreciate the support of setting up the google calendar and encouragement to think on tiem man. that Turing offers. 
I will explain functions to my kids after this! A function is a way to define an action that you can use over and over in your code.
arguments: the actual data, parameters: placeholders
